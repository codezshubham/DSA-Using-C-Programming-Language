This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in C. It is designed as a comprehensive resource 
for students, developers, and anyone interested in learning and mastering DSA concepts using the C programming language.

Features:
Basic Data Structures: Implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
Algorithms: Sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.), searching algorithms, graph traversal (BFS, DFS), dynamic programming, and more.
Code Examples: Each data structure and algorithm includes well-commented code examples and explanations.
Practice Problems: A set of problems to practice and enhance understanding of DSA concepts.
Documentation: Clear and concise documentation for each implementation.
